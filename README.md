## Overview
Citibikes took our trip in New York City to the next level. We were able to ride wherever we wanted to go. Could we start a similar bike program in our hometown, Des Moines, IA? Iâ€™ve analyzed the data to show how we could create a successful similar program here in Des Moines.

## Results

This is an overview of the data. The visual on the left shows a breakdown of the amount of rides by hour and day of the week. You can see a lot of people must use the bikes to commute to work, since 6am-9am and 5pm-7pm are popular week day trip times. The middle of the day on weekends is also quite popular. There are a lot more subscribers than customers, as you can see in the top pie chart. This shows that we will want to market our program to commuters with subscription plans.  There are a lot more male customers than female customers, as you can see in the lower pie chart.

Digging into the data a little further you can see Thursdays have the most trips and males definitely use the bikes more than females. You can also see the average trip time by birth year.

This third page combines the number of rides by time and day with gender. The peak rental times are the same and males definitely use the bikes more than females or unknown genders.

This line graph shows trip length at different times of the day.

Finally, this line graph breaks up the previous one by gender.


## Summary
As you have seen in multiple visuals, the bikes are used for commuting to work. More males use the bikes than females. One of the pie charts on the first page showed the subscriber to customer ratio. For our bike program in Des Moines to be a success, we should market subscriptions for people to commute to work. The marketing could target males, specifically, or be more inclusive to make our program a closer to equal gender spread. We can also market for people to use the bikes on weekends to explore the beautiful city of Des Moines. Below is a link to the story on Tableau so you can interact with the different graphs.
